        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I’m Sriram, a passionate Computer Science Engineering student with a keen interest in technology and its ever-evolving landscape. Currently, I'm diving deep into full-stack web development, with expertise in both the Vanilla stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I also have a strong command of programming languages like C, C++, and JavaScript that enable me to tackle challenges from multiple angles.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my web development skills, I’m a big believer in the power of data. I specialize in data analysis and visualization, transforming complex datasets into insightful business strategies using tools like Power BI and Tableau. This helps businesses make data-driven decisions, which is something I’m incredibly passionate about.
        </p>
        <span class="more-text">
        <p>
            Over the years, I’ve worked on a variety of hands-on projects that allowed me to combine my technical knowledge and creativity. From developing a self-ordering restaurant platform to building a Netflix-like streaming app, I’ve enjoyed every moment of problem-solving and creating impactful solutions. Currently, I’m working on a real-time education platform, leveraging my skills in web technologies to create seamless learning experiences for users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond coding, I’m constantly exploring new areas like IoT, Generative AI, and networking, always keeping an eye on the latest trends to expand my toolkit. I hold certifications from Oracle, Cisco, and Tata, which have provided me with not just formal education but hands-on practical knowledge to apply in real-world scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to continue growing as a developer, data analyst, and problem-solver. I believe in making a lasting impact by building products that are not only functional but also meaningful. Whether it's improving the user experience or creating data solutions that drive business success, I'm always looking to contribute my expertise and collaborate with like-minded individuals to bring ideas to life.
        </p>
        
            I'm also passionate about integrating digital marketing strategies with my web development work to ensure the projects I create are not only technically sound but also visible and impactful in the digital world. Always up for new challenges and eager to learn, I'm excited about the future and the potential for innovation that lies ahead.
